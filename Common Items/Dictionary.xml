            <!--
            To include a term in the list of terms that code analysis identifies as correctly spelled, 
            add the term as the inner text of a Dictionary/Words/Recognized/Word element. 
            Terms in Dictionary/Words/Recognized/Word elements are not case-sensitive.
            
            This is a list of case-insensitive words that do not exist in the dictionary
            but you still want to be considered as recognized by 
            IdentifiersShouldBeSpelledCorrectly. Do not add compound words (e.g. 'FileName') 
            to this list as this will cause CompoundWordsShouldBeBeCasedCorrectly to fire on 
            usages of the compound word stating that they should be changed to their discrete equivalent 
            (for example 'FileName' -> 'Filename').

            but you do not want to be recognized by IdentifiersShouldBeSpelledCorrectly.

            used by UsePreferredTerms. The deprecated terms are case-insensitive, 
            however, make sure to pascal-case the preferred alternates. If a word 
            does not have a preferred alternate, simply leave it blank.

            <!-- 
            This is a list of discrete terms with their compound alternates and is used by 
            CompoundWordsShouldBeCasedCorrectly. These are words that exist in the 
            dictionary as discrete terms, however, should actually be cased as compound words. 
            For example, 'Filename' exists in the dictionary and hence the spelling rules will 
            not see it as unrecognized but its actual preferred usage is 'FileName'; adding it
            below causes CompoundWordsShouldBeCasedCorrectly to fire. The discrete terms are 
            case-insensitive, however, be sure to pascal-case the compound alternates.
            Any discrete terms added below automatically get added to the list of discrete
            exceptions to prevent CompoundWordsShouldBeCasedCorrectly from firing both on the
            compound word (for example 'WhiteSpace') and its discrete alternate (for example 
            'Whitespace').

            This is a list of case-insensitive exceptions to the CompoundWordsShouldBeCasedCorrectly 
            discrete term check. As this check works solely on the basis of whether two consecutive
            tokens exists in the dictionary, it can have a high false positive rate. For example, 
            'onset' exists in the dictionary but the user probably intended it to be 'OnSet'. 
            Adding this word below prevents this rule from firing telling the user to change 'OnSet' 
            to 'Onset'.
